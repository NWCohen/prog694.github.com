## Get Involved!
We are Stuyvesant High School's award winning FIRST Robotics team.  FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international, non-profit organization which promotes the spread of science and technology. We partner with local businesses, educational institutions and volunteer mentors to cultivate skills in teamwork, strategic thinking, and community outreach.

- A FIRST team spends thousands of dollars on registration fees, a basic kit of parts, additional building materials, robot transportation, administrative expenses, and more.
- In addition to funds, we seek [mentors](/about/mentors/) who are specialists or hobbyists in engineering design, machine operation, programming, or marketing, and who are willing to work with highly motivated students from NYCâ€™s most highly rated science high school!
