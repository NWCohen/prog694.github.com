2012 was a terrible and fantastic season all at the same time. We had huge problems with our materials taking a long time to arrive causing us to sit on our hands for basically 2 weeks of our 6 week build season. As a result the robot was never properly tested and we struggled heavily at the New York City Regional but because of great driving and strategy we managed to become the eighth alliance captain and finished in the quarter finals. As in 2011 we overhauled many features of our robot going into the Connecticut Regional. We were the seventh alliance captain and finished in the quarter-finals again. We did force a third match in the quarter-finals against the second alliance shocking everyone in the event by pulling off the triple balance with the use of the "stingers" we added for the Connecticut Regional. During the awards ceremony we took the most prestigious award in F.I.R.S.T., the Chairman's award, for the third straight season which qualified us for the championship. At the Championship in St. Louis we played very hard but suffered some serious mechanical failures but we did manage to walk away with a 6-3 record which unfortunately was not enough to make the elimination rounds.
