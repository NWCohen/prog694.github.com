Stuy Splash is an intensive camp for FRC, covering everything from the foundation of your robot to the 0's and 1's that make it overweight. In 2012 it was held at the New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn on December 15th.

Our presentations from Stuy Splash 2012 can be found [here](/resources/stuysplash2012/).
