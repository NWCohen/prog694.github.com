In an effort to better organize data of the team, our web team has developed Team Manager. The neat interface conveniently allows team leaders to enter members' information much more easily than the conventional spreadsheet. Tracking the status of forms and papers has never been easier. This project is open source, so other teams are free to fork our code and use it themselves.

Check out the source code for Team Manager on [GitHub](https://github.com/prog694/teammanager).
